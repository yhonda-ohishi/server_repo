   - Edge: concurrent registrations

2. **Circuit Breaker Transitions**
   - Closed → Open (failure threshold)
   - Open → Half-Open (timeout)
   - Half-Open → Closed (success)
   - Half-Open → Open (failure)

3. **Connection Pool Management**
   - Acquire connection (available)
   - Acquire connection (wait)
   - Acquire connection (timeout)
   - Release connection
   - Pool expansion/contraction

   - Strategy: best_effort
   - Strategy: sequential
   - Batch size limits

#### Critical Paths - Middleware
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Valid API key
   - Invalid API key
   - Expired API key
   - Missing API key
   - Permission check pass/fail

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Under limit

| cache.go | 40% | 100% | 60% | 5 |
| auth.go | 50% | 100% | 50% | 5 |

### CLI Package (0% → 90%)
Total Lines: ~2,000

| Component | Current | Target | Priority | Tests Needed |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|--------------|
| services.go | 0% | 90% | LOW | 10 |
| cache.go | 0% | 90% | LOW | 8 |
| apikey.go | 0% | 90% | LOW | 12 |

## Edge Cases and Error Conditions

### Concurrency Edge Cases

   - Write timeout
   - Idle timeout

2. **Partial Failures**
   - Request sent, response lost
   - Partial batch completion
   - Circuit breaker half-open failures

### Resource Edge Cases
1. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Memory limits
   - Connection limits
   - File descriptor limits
   - Goroutine leaks

2. **Cleanup Failures**
