# Implementation Plan: 100% Test Coverage

**Branch**: `coverage-100` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/coverage-100/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Achieve 100% test coverage for the DB Handler Server by implementing comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, contract tests, and performance tests across all components, ensuring complete code coverage with focus on critical paths and edge cases.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+
**Primary Dependencies**:
- testify (assertions and mocks)
- gomock (interface mocking)
- httptest (HTTP testing)
- go-cov (coverage analysis)
- vegeta (load testing)
**Storage**: Test fixtures and mock data
**Testing**: go test with -cover flag, parallel execution
**Target Platform**: CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
**Project Type**: single (backend API server with comprehensive testing)
**Performance Goals**: 100% code coverage, <5s unit tests, <30s integration tests
**Constraints**: Tests must be deterministic, independent, and maintainable
**Scale/Scope**: ~50 source files requiring test coverage

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] Library-First Principle: Test utilities as reusable libraries
- [x] CLI Interface: Coverage reports via CLI commands
- [x] Test-First: TDD approach with tests before implementation
- [x] Integration Testing: Comprehensive integration test suite
- [x] Observability: Coverage metrics and reporting
- [x] Simplicity: Start with unit tests, then integration

**Structure Decision**: Comprehensive test organization by type and component

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Analyze current coverage**:
   - Run coverage analysis on existing code
   - Identify uncovered lines and branches
   - Map critical paths needing tests
   - Document coverage gaps

2. **Research testing best practices**:
   - Go testing patterns
   - Mock strategy for dependencies
   - Performance testing approaches
   - Coverage tool comparison

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   - Current coverage metrics
   - Gap analysis
   - Testing strategy recommendations

**Output**: research.md with coverage gaps and strategy

## Phase 1: Design & Test Strategy
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Create test strategy** → `test-strategy.md`:
   - Test categories and priorities
   - Mock strategy for each service
   - Test data management
   - Parallel execution plan

2. **Design coverage targets** → `coverage-report.md`:
   - Component-wise coverage goals
   - Critical path identification
   - Edge case documentation
   - Performance benchmarks

3. **Generate test templates**:
   - Unit test template
   - Integration test template
   - Performance test template
   - Helper function library

4. **Create quickstart guide** → `quickstart.md`:
   - How to run tests
   - Coverage report generation
   - CI/CD integration
   - Troubleshooting guide

5. **Update CLAUDE.md**:
   - Add testing context
   - Coverage goals
   - Test execution commands

**Output**: test-strategy.md, coverage-report.md, quickstart.md, updated CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Unit tests for each uncovered function
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Performance tests for load scenarios
- Coverage report generation tasks
- CI/CD pipeline updates

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Unit tests first (quick feedback)
- Integration tests second
- Performance tests last
- Parallel execution where possible

**Estimated Output**: 40-50 tasks for comprehensive coverage

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Unit test implementation
**Phase 4**: Integration test implementation
**Phase 5**: Performance test implementation
**Phase 6**: Coverage validation and reporting

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | - | - |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
